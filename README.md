# ndarray-solve-ivp

This is intended to be a duplicate of the [ODE IVP solvers in
SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html#solving-initial-value-problems-for-ode-systems)
using the Rust crate [`ndarray`](https://crates.io/crates/ndarray) for the
array type. The numerical results should be identical.
